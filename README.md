# KATA-LOG

This repository holds various exercises and code katas for archival purposes.

Each project should be self-contained and may even be a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). That also means each project should have its own `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and it's own dependencies.

New katas or exercises should be added as a branch and merged in via a PR process in order to preserve an edit log for a particular exercise.
