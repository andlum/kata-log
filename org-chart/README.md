# Org Chart

Given an Org Chart as a tree, write a method that finds the employee in the org chart and prints out the employee's role, number of direct reports, and total number of reports via standard output.

## Requirements
- Employees can be a `manager` or an `ic`
  - A `manager` has direct reports
  - An `ic` has no direct reports (represented by `undefined` for this exercise)
- Assume that all employee names are unique
